This repository contains **different controllers based on various plants**. All experiments were made in MATLAB and are numbered as:

1. Adaptative control
2. Parameter estimation based on least squares
3. Self-tuning regulator
4. Non-linear modelling based on [MOAB by Microsoft](https://microsoft.github.io/moab/)
5. Extended Kalman filter
6. Feedback linearization based on a Parrot Mambo model _(still ongoing)_

Each experiment folder contains a script folder and the report PDF, HTML and MATLAB LiveScript (`.mlx`) file. 

This study was based on the subject "Analysis and Project of Control Systems", chaired by Professor Antonio Marcus Nogueira Lima in the Electrical Engineering Master 
course in the Federal University of Campina Grande.
